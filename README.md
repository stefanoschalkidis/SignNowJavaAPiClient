## About SignNow

SignNow allows you to embed legally-binding e-signatures into your app, CRM or cloud storage. Send documents for signature directly from your website. Invite multiple signers to finalize contracts. Track status of your requests and download signed copies automatically.

This is a two module application which consists of the client-lib library and the example-app module. The client-lib library is used to interact with SignNow API. It covers all the authentication routines, request building and provides simple DTO objects to use in your applications. The second module, example-app, is a Spring Boot application which contains implementation examples of SignNow API use-cases.

Read about the available SignNow features in [SignNow API Docs](https://docs.signnow.com) .

## <a name="get-started"></a>Get started
To start using the API you have to create a SignNow account [here](https://www.signnow.com/developers)

Make sure you have Maven installed. Checkout this repo, cd into repo root directory and run:
```
mvn clean install -pl client-lib
```
This will add the client lib into your local Maven repo.
Alternatively you can download a release artifact and its corresponding *POM* and run the following
in the download directory:
```
mvn install:install-file \
    -Dfile=api-client-lib-1.0.5.jar \
    -DgroupId=com.signnow \
    -DartifactId=api-client-lib \
    -Dversion=1.0.5 \
    -Dpackaging=jar \
    -DpomFile=pom.xml
```
Next, add a dependency to your app pom file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.signnow</groupId>
    <artifactId>api-client-lib</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.5</version>
</dependency>   
```

In your code get SN API client instance by calling the next method with corresponding parameters:
```java
SNClientBuilder.get("apiUrl", "clientId", "clientSecret");
```

If you'd like to run an example application - set parameters named in the ```\example-app\src\main\resources\application.properties```
Feel free to try the provided examples and explore the corresponding code.

## <a name="examples"></a>Examples 
To run the examples you will need an API key. You can get one here https://www.signnow.com/api. For a full list of accepted parameters, refer to the SignNow REST Endpoints API guide: https://docs.signnow.com/reference.

**Note:** In the following examples we've listed only the common use-cases but this list shouldn't limit your requests. The client library provides an all-purpose wrapper and DTO objects for any API call to SignNow. Feel free to use any method from the client library.
